# Introduction

This is an accompanying paper for [@P2688R3] with respect to customization points
in the library. At the Wrocław meeting in November 2024, the following poll was
taken in EWG:

> Poll: [@P2688R3] — Pattern Matching: `match` Expression, we encourage more work
> on the language-only paper towards C++26 in the next meeting (note: voting
> against this poll does not exclude getting pattern matching in C++29)

The "language-only paper" still relies on library facilities, the same way that
structured bindings is a "language-only" feature that relies on library facilities
as a hook for customization.

A [Reflection-based Tuple-like and Variant-like Customization Points] has been
explored, but the design decision for [@P2688R3] targeting C++26 is to use
the existing facilities.

[Reflection-based Tuple-like and Variant-like Customization Points]: https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p2688r3.html#reflection-based-tuple-like-and-variant-like-customization-points

This makes it such that even a "language-only paper" is plenty useful without
any library changes. However, there is one customization point that is currently
missing: the ability for user-defined types to opt-in as an open sum type.

This paper proposes to add that customization point.

# Motivation and Scope

## Sum Types

First, definitions.  A "sum type" `SUM` is a type that represents one of
several types in the set `S` = {`T0`, `T1`, ... `TN`}.  Which `Ti` `SUM`
represents is a runtime property.

The set of types `S` is part of the definition of `SUM`, but the exact
elements of `S` might not be known at the time `SUM` is defined.  For
instance: for `std::variant<int, double>`, `S` = `{int, double}`; however, for
`std::any`, `S` = `{x | x is a copyable C++ type}`.  Though we know that
`std::any` can hold any copyable type, we don't know all the copyable types
that might exist in a program.

If all the elements `S` are known at the time that `SUM` is defined, we say
that `SUM` is a "closed" sum type (e.g. `std::variant<int, double>`).  If the
members of the set are *not* known at the time `SUM` is defined, we say that
`SUM` is an "open" sum type (e.g. `std::any`).

## Implications for Pattern Matching

[@P2688R3] proposes an alternative pattern which has syntax like the following:

```cpp
int f(const std::variant<int, double>& v) {
  return v match {
    int: let i => i;
    double: let d => int(d);
  };
}
```

This uses the "variant-like" protocol which uses the existing set of variant
helpers: `variant_size`, `variant_alternative`, `get`, and `index`.

However, for open sum types, there is no such existing facility.  `std::any`
and `std::exception_ptr` are examples of such types.

### C++23

```cpp
int f(const std::any& a) {
  if (auto* i = std::any_cast<int>(&a)) {
    return *i;
  } else if (auto* d = std::any_cast<double>(&a)) {
    return *d;
  } else {
    return -1;
  }
}
```

### P2688 with This Paper

```cpp
int f(const std::any& a) {
  return a match -> int {
    int: let i => i;
    double: let d => d;
    _ => -1;
  };
}
```

[@P2927R2] mentions a desired pattern matching use case for `std::exception_ptr`.
The example is written with [@P1371R3], but the following is what it would look
like with [@P2688R3]:

::: cmptable

### C++23

```cpp
void f(const std::exception_ptr& eptr) {
  if (auto* e = std::exception_ptr_cast<logic_error>(eptr)) {
    // use `*e`
  } else if (auto* e = std::exception_ptr_cast<exception>(eptr)) {
    // use `*e`
  } else if (ep == nullptr) {
    std::print("no exception");
  } else {
    std::print("some other exception");
  }
}
```

### P2688 with This Paper

```cpp
void f(const std::exception_ptr& eptr) {
  eptr match {
    logic_error: let e => // use `e`
    exception: let e => // use `e`
    nullptr => std::print("no exception");
    _ => std::print("some other exception");
  };
}
```

This paper proposes `try_cast` as the customization point that pattern matching
invokes to test and extract the state of open sum types.

# Design Overview

The [Alternative Pattern] as proposed in [@P2688R3] considers the following 3 cases in order:

  1. Variant-like
  2. Casts
  3. Polymorphic types

[Alternative Pattern]: https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p2688r3.html#alternative-pattern

This is modeled similarly to structured bindings protocol, which considers
the following 3 cases:

  1. Array
  2. Tuple-like
  3. Aggregate types

The cast protocol is the only one that needs library support for `std`
entities to benefit from it.

The proposal is to add `try_cast` overloads that handle casts of `std::any`
using `std::any_cast`, and casts of `std::exception_ptr` using
`std::exception_ptr_cast` from P2927R2.

This works because the language feature itself uses `try_cast` if available.
Casts of user-defined types using calls to `try_cast` found via ADL, will also
work, such as:

```cpp
namespace ns {
  struct Widget { /* ... */ };

  template <typename T>
  const T* try_cast(const Widget& w) noexcept {
    return // ...
  };
}
```

## How does pattern matching actually use this?

Given an example like:

```cpp
@*subject*@ match {
  @*type*@: @*subpattern*@ => // ...;
  _ => // ...;
};
```

Conceptually: `try_cast<@*type*@>(@*subject*@)` is invoked, which returns an
optional result that can be tested and dereferenced to match the *subpattern*.

More precisely: Let `E` be `try_cast<@*type*@>(@*subject*@)`.  The call to
`try_cast` is done using ADL-only lookup, just as is done with calls to `get`
for structured bindings (see [dcl.struct.bind]{.sref}).

The match is well-formed if and only if:

  - `E` is well-formed;
  - `E` is contextually convertible to `bool`; and
  - `E` is dereferencable.

A well-formed match succeeds if and only if `E` contextually converts to
`true` and `*E` matches *subpattern*.

# Design Alternatives

## Overload `any_cast`

Adding new overloads of `any_cast` was considered as a way to opt-in as
an any-like type. Effectively designating variant-like as the closed sum type
opt-in, and any-like as the open sum type opt-in.

The reason this approach is not taken is purely technical. The current overloads
of `any_cast` include versions that takes `any` by reference. Since `any` is
implicitly constructible from anything, testing the validity of `any_cast` is
virtually always true.

## Parameters as Pointers

It was considered to take the parameters by pointer instead to avoid the
implicit construction of `any` from anything problem:

```cpp
namespace std {
  template <typename T>
  const T* try_cast(const any* a) noexcept { return any_cast<T>(a); }

  template <typename T>
  T* try_cast(any* a) noexcept { return any_cast<T>(a); }

  template <typename T>
  const T* try_cast(const exception_ptr* p) noexcept {
    if (!p) return nullptr;
    return exception_ptr_cast<T>(*p); // P2927R2
  }
}
```

This solves the problem of having to specify `same_as<any>` constraint,
but it makes the rest of the overloads less obvious and familiar.

## Use a `std::hash`-like Approach

This approach is to make `try_cast` be a class template that users specialize,
rather than an overload set.

```cpp
namespace std {
  template <typename>
  struct try_cast; // undefined

  template <>
  struct try_cast<std::any> {
    template <typename T>
    static const T* to(const std::any& a) noexcept {
      return std::any_cast<T>(&a);
    }

    template <typename T>
    static T* to(std::any& a) noexcept {
      return std::any_cast<T>(&a);
    }
  };

  template <>
  struct try_cast<std::exception_ptr> {
    template <typename T>
    static const T* to(const std::exception_ptr& p) noexcept {
      return std::exception_ptr_cast<T>(p); // P2927R2
    }
  };
}
```

This allows the parameters to become references again. There are two downsides
of this approach:

  1. The user-defined type needs to re-open the `std` namespace in order to
     provide the specialization.
  2. The API becomes `std::try_cast<From>::to<To>(from)`, compared to
     the proposed API which would be simply `try_cast<To>(from)`.

## Create a `try_cast` CPO

This approach was seriously considered by the authors, but discarded.  We
wrote wording for it and everything.  While it may be useful for users in
general, it is a terrible fit for use by a language feature.  The CPO would
have to live in a particular header.  That header would then need to be
included wherever a `type:` pattern was applied to an open sum type.

In the general case, the user would have no obvious way of noticing that this
requirement was not met.  They would just get a diagnostic telling them to
`#include` the right header.  Users already have to deal with this
occasionally when the compiler informs them that they forgot to include
`<initializer_list>`.

Note that the tuple protocol uses direct calls to the overloads that it
requires for producing structured bindings, and this decision is in line with
that.  In any case, the decision not to use a CPO is already made; it's part
of the language feature.
